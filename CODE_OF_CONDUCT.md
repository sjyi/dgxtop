- Being welcoming and patient with newcomers and those learning
- Using inclusive and respectful language
- Maintaining a professional tone in all interactions
- Staying focused on technical topics and constructive feedback
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, and any other communication channels used by the project. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on this repository or contacting the maintainers through GitHub. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Consequence:** A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
